# ALMPP

**The Advanced Lightweight Minecraft Punish Plugin** is a powerful but super lightweight Punishment Plugin designed for paper servers.

## Installation

Download the latest plugin Jar file from the [GitHub releases page.](https://github.com/Coadon/ALMPP/releases)

To install the plugin to your server, put the Jar file into your server plugins folder.

Then, if your server is running, reload your server.

Since this plugin is using the PaperAPI for minecraft 1.16, this plugin only supports paper servers with a minecraft version above 1.16.1.

Other server software including bukkit and spigot is not tested and may not guarantee plugin performance.

## Usage

This plugin improves the Punishment features in vanilla Minecraft. It introduces the feature to permanently and temporarily ban players,
It also includes an improved, cleaner ban gui.

For in-depth documentation on how to use this plugin, please refer to the [wiki.](https://github.com/Coadon/ALMPP/wiki)
